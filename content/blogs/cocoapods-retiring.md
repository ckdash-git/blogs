It’s the end of an era for the iOS ecosystem. After 15 years, **CocoaPods is retiring.**

Mark your calendar: **December 2, 2026** — the trunk goes permanently read-only.



## Why move to SPM?
1. **Native Integration:** Built directly into Xcode.
2. **No Ruby:** No more Gemfile or version conflicts.
3. **Speed:** Faster indexing and dependency resolution.

**Start now. Go slow. And yeah — thanks, CocoaPods!**
