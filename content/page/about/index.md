Hello! I am **Chandan Kumar**, a software engineer with a deep passion for building secure, scalable, and impactful software solutions.

Currently, I am working at a **leading Japanese cyber security company**, where I focus on developing advanced security tools and infrastructure. Prior to this, I honed my skills as an **SDE-iOS** at a dynamic **Silicon Valley company**, working on cutting-edge mobile applications.

### The Intersection of Tech & Humanities

My academic background is somewhat unique in the tech world. I hold **Master's degrees in both Computer Science and Political Science**.

This dual perspective allows me to approach technical problems with a broader context, understanding not just *how* to build technology, but *why* it matters and how it impacts society, business, and governance.

### Writing & Interests

When I'm not writing code, I'm writing articles. I love to explore and articulate thoughts on a wide range of topics, including:

*   **Computer Science**: Deep dives into algorithms, system design, and security.
*   **Humanities**: Reflections on history, politics, and social dynamics.
*   **Business Studies**: Analyzing market trends and economic principles.
*   **Interesting Facts**: Curating and sharing fascinating knowledge from various fields.

### Projects & Open Source

I am an active contributor to the open-source community and have developed several applications. Here are a few of my notable projects:

1.  **[Optional (iOS/Android)](https://optionallabs.com/)**
2.  **[ColorsKit (iOS)](https://github.com/ckdash-git/ColorsKit)**
3.  **[ScreenShield (iOS)](https://github.com/ckdash-git/ScreenShield)**
